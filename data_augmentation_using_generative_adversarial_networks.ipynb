    "One of the biggest bottlenecks in creating generalized deep learning models is a scarcity of high-quality data. The collection of high-quality data and its conversion is expensive. Most of the data collection methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring considerable editing afterward to clean the data. Since large amounts of data are needed to achieve generalized deep learning models, standard data augmentation methods are routinely used to increase the dataset's generalizability. Data augmentation methods are also used when the datasets are imbalanced, improving the model's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks, popularly known as GANs, are a novel method for data augmentation. The generation of artificial training data can not only be instrumental in situations such as imbalanced data sets, but it can also be useful when the original dataset contains sensitive information. In such cases, it is then desirable to avoid using the original data as much as possible (For example, Medical data).\n",
    "\n",
    "This report proposes a GAN architecture based on a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) from UC Berkeley to perform data augmentation using the popular image-to-image translation method. Generative Adversarial Networks trained on these methods learn the mapping from an input image to an output image and learn a loss function to train this mapping. Therefore, this approach makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally require very different loss formulations. In this particular report, we demonstrate that this approach can effectively synthesize photos from label maps. To evaluate the performance of the proposed GAN architecture, we utilize a standard dataset named Cityscapes. The Cityscapes Dataset focuses on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. The dataset contains 5000 images with detailed annotations and 20000 images with coarse annotations apart from the original images. Some sample images from the dataset are presented below:\n",

    "With the advancements in deep learning, the most striking successes have involved discriminative models, usually those that map a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label. These striking successes have primarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units. However, deep generative models have had less impact due to the challenges of approximating many probabilistic computations that occur due to the usage of piecewise linear units in the generative context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks, popularly known as GANs, is a machine learning framework class that sidesteps these difficulties by pitting the generative model against an adversary. In other words, a GAN is a machine learning framework where two neural networks compete against each other in a zero-sum game (i.e., one network's gain is the other network's loss). The two networks in a GAN can be considered as a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to create images that look real, while the discriminator learns to tell real images apart from fakes. Competition in this game drives both networks to improve their models until the counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine images. An overview of the Generative Adversarial Network is represented below:\n",

    "One of the most significant characteristics of GANs is the lack of loss function. GANs learn the loss function to classify if the output image is real or fake while simultaneously training a generative model to minimize this loss. This property of GANs allows it to learn a loss that adapts to the data, making them a perfect solution to a multitude of tasks that traditionally would require very different kinds of loss functions such as image-to-image translation. The image-to-image translation is the task of translating one possible representation of a scene into another, given sufficient training data. Traditionally, each image-to-image translation task has been tackled with separate, special-purpose machinery, although the setting is always the same: predict pixels from pixels. The biggest problem with this approach is the need to formulate specialized loss functions that drive the neural network to do what we want – e.g., output sharp, realistic images. Fortunately, the need for specialized loss functions is precisely eliminated with the use of GANs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we explore GANs in the conditional setting. Just as GANs learn a generative data model, conditional GANs (cGANs) learn a conditional generative model. In other words, just as GANs are generative models that learn a mapping from random noise vector $z$ to output image $y$, $G:\\,z\\,\\rightarrow\\,y$, the conditional GANs (cGANs) learn a mapping from observed image $x$ and random noise vector $z$, to output image $y$,$G:\\,\\{x,\\, z\\}\\,\\rightarrow\\,y$. This ability to map from an observed image to an output image makes cGANs fitting for image-to-image translation tasks, where we condition on an input image and generate a corresponding output image. \n",
    "\n",
